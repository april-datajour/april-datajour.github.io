They call me April. I am graduating in May with a master's in health and medical journalism. This website was made
for my Data Journalism class where I learned how to do basic HTML/CSS coding, how to clean up data in Excel, 
and that JavaScript was my new enemy. Below are examples of what I can do.

<p>For the past three years the number of available primary care residency slots in Georgia have increased with the growing number of graduating medical students. Experts believe this increase has potential for reducing the primary care physician gap in the state.

Primary care involves comprehensive care to a patient, which requires an ongoing relationship. The core specialties that make up primary care are internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. 

At the beginning of the fourth year of medical school, students decide what specialty they would like to pursue as a career and then apply for open slots in graduate medical training programs, called residencies, across the globe. Students interview with these residency programs and then both the student and the institution rank list their preferences. However, the final choice is made by a computer system through the National Resident Matching Program, which compares both list rankings and makes the match.
